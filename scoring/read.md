This are isntructions; each of the type of scores are as follows:
\n
P1-penalty version 1;\n 
P2-penalty version 2;\n 
R-Reward\n

You need the Reward, the penalty version depends on your preference. \n

Note that based on your dependencies, you may not be able to read the pickle files once you switch machines, so we added a conversion script to convert the pickle to json so that it can be more conveniently read. You are welcome.
\n

The make scripts make the scores, whereas the py files with plt or var are used to plot the variations to capture the behaviours of the scores used.
